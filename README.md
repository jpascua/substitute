My first Chrome Extension project!

On any webpage, **Substitute 1.0** allows the user to replace any word with their own.

*How to Manually Set-Up:*  
1. Download the .zip.  
2. Extract the project folder to any convenient location on your PC.  
3. Open your *Chrome Browser* and go to chrome://extensions  
4. Click *Load Unpacked* and select the project folder.  

If enabled, the extension should now appear on Chrome (top-right corner).  
Click on the icon to get started. Have fun!
