My first Chrome Extension project.

On any webpage, **Substitute 1.0** allows the user to replace any word with their own!

**How to Manually Set-Up:**
1. Download the .zip.
2. Extract the project folder to any convenient location on your PC.
3. Open your *Chrome browser* and go to chrome://extensions
4. Click *Load Unpacked* and select the project folder.

If enabled, the extension should now appear on Chrome (top-right corner).
Click on the icon to get started. Have fun!
